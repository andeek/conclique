Description: This package is a collection of helpful functions for dealing with spatial data and concliques. 
             Currently it contains functions for creating a minimal conclique cover as well as assigning the concliques
             to a regular lattice for plotting and simulation purposes. This package is under development and will 
             include additional functions for simulation of spatial data using a conclique-based Gibbs sampler.
