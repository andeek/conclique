Description: Gibbs sampling for spatial data using Markov Random Fields and concliques. 
             Currently contains functionality for creating a minimal conclique cover as well as assigning the concliques
             to a regular lattice for plotting and simulation purposes. This package is under development and will 
             include simulation of spatial data using a conclique-based Gibbs sampler.
