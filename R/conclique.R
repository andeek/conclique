#' conclique: Gibbs sampling for spatial data and concliques
#' 
#' Gibbs sampling for spatial data using Markov Random Fields and concliques. 
#' Currently contains functionality for creating a minimal conclique cover as well as assigning the concliques
#' to a regular lattice for plotting and simulation purposes. This package is under development and will 
#' include simulation of spatial data using a conclique-based Gibbs sampler.
